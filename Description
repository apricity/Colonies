Logic: the organism is asked for its Intention (defined as a plugin)

Intentions:
  - None
    * Summary: completely indifferent to surroundings and perform no action or interaction
    * Phase: none
    * Positive bias: none
    * Negative bias: none
  - Eat
    * Summary: take nutrient from inventory or environment to restore health
    * Phase: action 
    * Positive bias: nutrient, pheromone, sound
    * Negative bias: damp, heat, disease
  - Havest
    * Summary: gather nutrient from environment to store in inventory
    * Phase: action
    * Positive bias: nutrient, pheromone
    * Negative bias: damp, heat, disease
  - Nourish
    * Summary: use nutrient in inventory to provide nutrient to audible organisms
    * Phase: interaction
    * Positive bias: sound
    * Negative bias: pheromone, damp, heat, disease
  - Mine
    * Summary: gather mineral from environment to store in inventory
    * Phase: action
    * Positive bias: mineral
    * Negative bias: damp, heat, disease, obstruction
  - Build
    * Summary: use mineral in inventory to build obstructions to prevent the spread of hazards
    * Phase: action
    * Positive bias: sound, damp, heat, disease
    * Negative bias: obstruction
  - Nest
    * Summary: locate environment with mineral level
    * Phase: none
    * Positive bias: mineral
    * Negative bias: damp, heat, disease
  - Reproduce
    * Summary: generate spawn from a full mineral deposit while having very high health
    * Phase: action
    * Positive bias: none
    * Negative bias: none
  - Birth
    * Summary: use spawn in inventory to create a new organism
    * Phase: interaction
    * Positive bias: none
    * Negative bias: damp, heat, disease
  
Phases:
  - Setup (afflict any organism in a hazardous environment, decide organism intention)
  - Action (perform action associated with intention)
  - Interaction (perform interaction associated with intention)
  - Movement (perform movement based on environment bias from intention, movement order biased towards most healthy)
  - Ambient (modify environment, e.g. pheromone fade, nutrient growth, weather levels, hazard spread)
