Colonies
========
A bit of fun while I tackle the WPF learning curve.

The goal is to produce an automated simulation of a very simple and naive ecosystem.
The real goal is to get to grips with WPF and MVVM (and other tools and techniques of the trade)
The *real* real goal is to have some fun playing with code.
